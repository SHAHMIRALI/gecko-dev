## Diagnosis/Solution

The issue is that the pointer "aMenu" passed in the function nsXULPopupManager,
orignally was being checked for nullity, but dereferenced later regardless if
aMenu was null or not. This would result in possible null pointer exceptions
being thrown. Currently, the function has no null checks, and it was suggested in
the bug that we can use a built-in assertion checker called MOZ_ASSERT, to accomplish
this. If it fails, no further code will be run, including the dereferencing. The 
solution is to simply add the checker for the pointer at the start of the function.

## Testing

For testing, I will describe the process. In order to see whether the patch works
or not, we will try to open a menu, that is initially null. Before the patch, it
will throw null pointer exceptions when its opened (for eg, when aMenu->IsXULElement 
is dereferenced, it will throw it), but after the patch, the built in checker should
see if aMenu is null. If it is, the menu will never be created or shown.
